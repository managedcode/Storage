# MCAF: .NET TUnit

## Trigger On

- the repo uses TUnit
- you need to add, run, debug, or repair TUnit tests
- the repo uses Microsoft.Testing.Platform-based test execution

## Value

- produce a concrete project delta: code, docs, config, tests, CI, or review artifact
- reduce ambiguity through explicit planning, verification, and final validation skills
- leave reusable project context so future tasks are faster and safer

## Do Not Use For

- xUnit projects
- MSTest projects
- generic test strategy with no TUnit-specific mechanics

## Inputs

- the nearest `AGENTS.md`
- the test project file and package references
- the repo's current TUnit execution command

## Quick Start

1. Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` and confirm scope and constraints.
2. Run this skill's `Workflow` through the `Ralph Loop` until outcomes are acceptable.
3. Return the `Required Result Format` with concrete artifacts and verification evidence.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the project really uses TUnit and not a different MTP-based framework.
2. Read the repo's real `test` command from `AGENTS.md`. If the repo has no explicit command yet, start with `dotnet test PROJECT_OR_SOLUTION`.
3. Keep the TUnit execution model intact:
   - tests are source-generated at build time
   - tests run in parallel by default
   - built-in analyzers should remain enabled
4. Fix isolation bugs instead of globally serializing the suite unless the repo already documented a justified exception.
5. Run the narrowest useful scope first. If the repo hasn't documented filter switches for TUnit yet, prefer project-level focused runs over guessed runner arguments.
6. Use `[Test]`, `[Arguments]`, hooks, and dependencies only when they make the scenario clearer, not because the framework allows it.

## Bootstrap When Missing

If `TUnit` is requested but not configured yet:

1. Detect current state:
   - `rg -n "TUnit|Microsoft\\.Testing\\.Platform" -g '*.csproj' -g 'Directory.Build.*' .`
2. Add the minimal package set to the test project:
   - `dotnet add TEST_PROJECT.csproj package TUnit`
   - `dotnet add TEST_PROJECT.csproj package Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`
3. Keep the runner model explicit in `AGENTS.md` and CI:
   - record that the repo uses Microsoft.Testing.Platform-compatible execution for this test project
   - record the exact `dotnet test TEST_PROJECT.csproj` command the repo will use
4. Add one small executable test using `[Test]`.
5. Run `dotnet test TEST_PROJECT.csproj` and return `status: configured` or `status: improved`.
6. If the repo intentionally standardizes on xUnit or MSTest, return `status: not_applicable` unless migration is explicitly requested.

## Deliver

- TUnit tests that respect source generation and parallel execution
- commands that work in local and CI runs
- framework-specific verification guidance for the repo

## Validate

- the command matches the repo's TUnit runner style
- shared state is isolated or explicitly controlled
- built-in TUnit analyzers remain active
- coverage tooling matches Microsoft.Testing.Platform if coverage is enabled

## Ralph Loop

Use the Ralph Loop for every task, including docs, architecture, testing, and tooling work.

1. Plan first (mandatory):
   - analyze current state
   - define target outcome, constraints, and risks
   - write a detailed execution plan
   - list final validation skills to run at the end, with order and reason
2. Execute one planned step and produce a concrete delta.
3. Review the result and capture findings with actionable next fixes.
4. Apply fixes in small batches and rerun the relevant checks or review steps.
5. Update the plan after each iteration.
6. Repeat until outcomes are acceptable or only explicit exceptions remain.
7. If a dependency is missing, bootstrap it or return `status: not_applicable` with explicit reason and fallback path.

### Required Result Format

- `status`: `complete` | `clean` | `improved` | `configured` | `not_applicable` | `blocked`
- `plan`: concise plan and current iteration step
- `actions_taken`: concrete changes made
- `validation_skills`: final skills run, or skipped with reasons
- `verification`: commands, checks, or review evidence summary
- `remaining`: top unresolved items or `none`

For setup-only requests with no execution, return `status: configured` and exact next commands.

## Load References

- read `references/tunit.md` first

## Example Requests

- "Run this TUnit project correctly."
- "Fix our TUnit CI command."
- "Add a regression test in TUnit without breaking parallelism."
